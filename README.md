# Node Funtime!

This is a repository that logs my Node experiments. Each directory is a different example or experiment, with more information contained in their respective README.md files.

I do include basic setup instructions, but this is under the assumption that you've installed a version of NodeJS higher than v7.6.0 for native async function support.

I currently use nvm to manage my node installations!
